chrome extensions


This repo contains chrome extensions that hide promoted posts. 

As a terminally online person, I find it quite frustrating when ads ruin my experience while browsing dying social media sites. These extensions remove that frustration and allow the user to experience an uninterrupted feed of garbage, free from advertisements.

To install:

From the chrome extensions management area, select "Load unpakced", then select the folder containing the extension. I think that's all there is to it, but i don't feel like double-checking.
